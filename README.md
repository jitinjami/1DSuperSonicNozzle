# MacormackMethod1DSuperSonicNozzle

Question:

In this challenge you are going to simulate the isentropic flow through a quasi 1D subsonic-supersonic nozzle. You will derive both the conservation and non-conservation forms of the governing equations and sovle them using the MacCormack's technique. You need to determine the steady-state temperature distribution for the flow-field variables and investigate the difference between the two forms of governing equations by comparing their solutions.
You need to show the following plots inside your report
1. Steady-state distribution of primitive variables inside the nozzle
2. Time-wise variation of the primitive variables
3. Variation of Mass flow rate distribution inside the nozzle at different time steps during the time-marching process
4. Comparison of Normalized mass flow rate distributions of both forms

Things to remember:
1. 'Report.pdf' has all the plots and equations.
2. 'macormack.m' is the main matlab file.
3. 'conserv.m' and 'nonconserv.m' are function files that need to run in the same directory as the main matlab file.
